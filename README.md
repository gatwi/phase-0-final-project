# MY PERSONAL PROJECT

## Objectives
The end-goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding so far of coding concepts and technologies such as html, css, and javascript.
My portfolio should be able to highlight my background knowledge on the aforementioned technologies.

## Introduction
Professional software engineers and web developers often have a personal
website. With that in mind, and my goal set on becoming a good developer, I have developed my first ever portfolio as ground work for further improvement and practice. I hope to one day look back to this project and marvel at the distance I will have covered to becoming a good developer.

## Technologies
This portfolio website is created using;
// html code
// css
// javascript code

## Recommended Workflow
- Created local and remote repos for your project and connected them together.
- Fork and clone the lesson into local environment. Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run code . to open files in Visual Studio Code. 
- Created the base files for your project: `README.md`, `index.html`,
  `style.css`, and `index.js`.
- Published your new site on GitHub Pages.
